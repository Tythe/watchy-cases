This is Boxy it embraces it’s squareness. There are no chamfers or rounded edges to try and hide it’s form just sharp 90-degree edges. I envisioned that the face would be easily swappable so you could have a different looking watch for a variety of occasions. Designed to be easily machined on a 3 -axis CNC with only single sided machining.

My printer required a bit of an indent to properly have the buttons depress but I included one without the indent for people with better calibrated printers.
