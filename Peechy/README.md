Hello,

Name : Peechy
Licence : Do whathever you want
List of files : Top, Bottom and Button

Here is **Peechy**, a cross design between _Pebble_ and _Watchy_.

STL Files : ( Can't upload STL directly )  [Peechy-STL.zip](https://github.com/sqfmi/watchy-cases/files/5939109/Peechy-STL.zip)

I'm not an expert in 3D or technical design, the files are not as clean as the reference design, I tried to submit a design that would fullfil my wishes about the watch.

What I love about Watchy, is the blunt design, I really likes the fact that you can see the components directly on your wrist, making the form being the function.
I appreciate a bit of comfort too, so I tried to mix the Watchy reference case, with the entire screen board visible and buttons a bit more integrated than the reference design.

Here is some **pictures** !
